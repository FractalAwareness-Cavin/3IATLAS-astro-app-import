3I/ATLAS Project Overview
===========================

This repository distributes data and helper scripts so that the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1) can be imported into several astrology/astronomy programs (Solar Fire, KStars, Stellarium, WinStars, Cartes du Ciel, SkySafari). The kit includes:
- MPC ephemerides (daily, one-line format)
- Orbital-element blocks for Solar Fire
- CSV vector tables
- Helper scripts and download bundles
- Localized documentation

Outstanding tasks / backlog:
- Update localized documentation (cs, de, el, es, fr, it, nl, pl, ru, Klingon placeholder) to reflect the new OS-specific helper filenames and instructions.
- Add remaining translations requested (Norwegian, Bulgarian, Swahili, Chinese, Japanese, Thai, Icelandic, Portuguese, Vietnamese, Naija Pidgin, Arabic, Hindi, Turkish, Korean, Bahasa, Romanian, Swedish/Danish, Finnish, Hungarian, Tagalog, Farsi, Urdu/Hindi variants).
- Verify macOS Gatekeeper instructions with screenshots if possible.
- Automate download ZIP creation (Makefile/script) so zips stay consistent with the README content.
- Optional: implement a CLI validation step with an offline-compatible tool.

Permissions / environment notes:
- The agent must not assume full disk access; confirm with repo owner (cav) before touching protected paths.
- Agent has permission to commit and push changes (`git commit`, `git push`).
- Network access is available for Horizons verification scripts.

Please keep README and download assets in sync whenever helper naming or workflows change.

Always rebuild the download zips whenever you update the data or instructionsâ€”they are the primary deliverables for end users.
