KStars Helper Location
======================

Use the release bundle `KStars_quick-append_Win-Mac-Linux.zip` (or the scripts in `tools/kstars/`).
The single-line entry is kept in the import pack and can also be generated by
`tools/update_orbital_elements.py`.

macOS Gatekeeper warning
------------------------
If macOS shows “Apple could not verify ‘KStars_Append_3I.command’ is free of malware…” when you double-click the helper:

1. Open **System Settings → Privacy & Security**.
2. Scroll to the bottom. If **Allow applications downloaded from** is not already set to *App Store & identified developers*, change it.
3. Launch the `.command` again; in the Gatekeeper dialog, click **Done** (do not choose *Move to Trash*).
4. Return to **System Settings → Privacy & Security**, scroll down, and click **Open Anyway** for `KStars_Append_3I.command`.
5. Open the `.command` once more and approve when prompted.***
