3I/ATLAS FOR ASTRO GOLD
=======================

This folder contains Solar Fire–style text tables that Astro Gold
(macOS and iOS/iPadOS) can import as a custom point.

macOS
-----
1. Unzip this package and locate `geocentric_daily_solarfire.txt`
   (use the Lahiri/Fagan-Bradley versions if you prefer sidereal).
2. Copy the file into
   `~/Library/Containers/au.com.esotech.AstroGoldMac/Data/Library/Application Support/Astro Gold/Ephemerides/`
   (create the `Ephemerides` folder if it does not exist).
3. Launch Astro Gold and open **Astro Gold → Settings… → Points → Custom Points**.
4. Click **Import** (or the **+** button), choose **Solar Fire Text** as the
   format, and select the file you copied.
5. Give the object a name such as `3I/ATLAS`, then enable it in the
   Custom Points list.
6. The new point can now be toggled in charts just like any other body.

iOS / iPadOS
------------
1. Use the Files app (or Finder when your device is connected to a Mac)
   to copy the desired `.txt` file into `On My iPhone/iPad → Astro Gold → Ephemerides`.
2. In Astro Gold go to **Settings → Points → Custom Points**.
3. Tap **Import**, choose **Solar Fire Text**, and select the file.
4. Name the object, enable it, and it will appear in the point list.

Tip: keep both tropical and sidereal files in the Ephemerides folder so
you can switch traditions quickly.
