3I/ATLAS FOR SOLAR FIRE (WINDOWS)
=================================

Use these Solar Fire–formatted text tables to add 3I/ATLAS as a custom
point inside Solar Fire (v8+).

1. Unzip this package and copy the desired `.txt` file (tropical or
   sidereal variant) into your user ephemeris folder, usually:
   `Documents\Solar Fire User Files\Ephemerides`.
2. Open Solar Fire and choose **File → Open Ephemeris → Import → Text**.
3. Browse to the file you copied. When prompted, map the three columns to
   **Longitude**, **Latitude**, and **Distance (AU)**. Leave the date/time
   format as the default.
4. Give the ephemeris a name (e.g. `3I_ATLAS`) and confirm the import.
5. Go to **Utilities → View/Edit Files → Ephemerides** (or **Chart Options
   → Points**) and assign the new ephemeris to an unused User point (User #1
   is common).
6. Enable that User point in your chart point selections. 3I/ATLAS will now
   appear anywhere Solar Fire displays custom bodies.

Optional: If you later create Swiss Ephemeris `.se1` files, place them in
`Documents\Solar Fire User Files\SWEPHEM` and reference them from the same
User point slot.
